    long_description='Fake news can spread up to 10 times faster than true reporting on social media. These often reach 100,000+ people within a few hours, and the implications can be devastating in spreading misinformation, even when corrected. AlHaq is a cross-platform service that tailors any userâ€™s social media feed to amplify trusted information within their social network using quantum computing. AlHaq can detect fake news from a social media user, rank the trustedness of members in their social network, and adapt their social media feed to boost true news sources and filter disinformation.',
